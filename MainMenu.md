The purpose of the new Main Menu is to add new starting menu items beside the original 5 option. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to remove the imprinted, language dependent text completely, therefore, I added a semi-transparent black overlay where the new menu items will reside.

## Single player ##

This will lead to a new single player game selection window with the ability to select a campaign or skirmish game, difficulty and possibly other options. (Still in design)

### Continue ###

Continue from the last save, if available

### Load ###

Display the new loading screen. (Still in design)

## Multiplayer ##

Start or join to a multiplayer game. Details on how the multiplayer will work is still in consideration.

## Settings ##

It will display the [Setup screen](http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Setup). The volume settings will be directly available on the in-game load/save screen.

## Videos ##

Play all available game videos. Possible option is to view videos on a discovery basis instead of showing all.

### Intro ###

Play the intro video. Same as in the original game.

### Title ###

Play the title video. Same as in the original game: the GT Interactive animation.

## Exit ##

Quit the program.

## EN / HU ##

Switch between the language versions. No need to go into the setup screen.
