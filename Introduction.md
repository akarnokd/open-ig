**Open Imperium Galactica** (Open-IG) is an open source [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)<sup>TM</sup> reimplementation of the [Digital Reality](http://www.digitalreality.hu) game [Imperium Galactica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_Galactica), a popular, 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) real-time space strategy game developed around 1996 in Hungary.

Open-IG attempts to reproduce the feel of the original game while fixing many bugs, inconsistencies and extending it with new features, however, it does not aim for producing an exact, behavior perfect and pixel perfect replica.

The project contains all necessary files to run the Open Imperium Galactica standalone: there is no need for the original game's files.

It should run on any platform supporting **Java 7**: e.g., Windows, Linux and Mac. You need to download the Launcher only once (unless noted otherwise). From then on, the Launcher will update the game or itself.

If you run into problems, crashes, translation errors, or simply want to share some of your ideas and suggestions, please create an [Issue](https://code.google.com/p/open-ig/issues/list). You may use **english**, **hungarian** or german language in your reports.
