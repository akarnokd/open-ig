  <entry key='database.discovering_planets.details'>It is very important to obtain information about planets. If a planet&#39;s name is not visible, it means you have not established contact with the planet. It could be empty, or have alien colonies on it. 
	First, you need to deploy a satellite to establish contact and retrieve vital statistics, e.g. if the planet is habitable or not. If you have a SAT in stock and click on an empty planet on the starmap you can deploy it by clicking on the add sat icon. It will soon start to relay information on the planet.
	The information relay will become more substantial as time progresses. If the planet is already inhabited, the satellite may be spotted, and destroyed. The next step would be to deploy a spy satellite. Spy sat 2.0 will relay more information and enable you spy on the alien race&#39;s colony of buildings when you select a planet. It will also relay information about the planetary defence forces.</entry>
  <entry key='database.effective_groudwar'>Effective ground battle strategies</entry>
  <entry key='database.effective_groudwar.details'>Use the pause function frequently (SPACE). Take your time to decide who you attack and with what. You can select groups by clicking the left mouse button and dragging. Use SHIFT + numbers to create groups. You may reselect these groups by pressing the numbers, e.g. SHIFT 1 will create group 1, SHIFT 2 group 2. If you press 1, then group 1 will be selected. When you attack or defend a colony, first you have to deploy your units. You must place them on the green squares. If you are attacking, you will start from the edge of the map. If you are defending your colony, you will be able to place units near your buildings. If you attack, some of the buildings will fire at you automatically (Garrisons, Fortresses, etc.). Avoid them if possible.</entry>
  <entry key='database.effective_spacewar'>Effective space battle strategies</entry>
  <entry key='database.effective_spacewar.details'>Use the pause function frequently (SPACE). Take your time to decide who you attack and with what. Flagships have large shields, but are slow. Try and refrain from sending them to different locations. You can select groups as well by clicking the left mouse button and dragging. Use SHIFT + numbers to create groups. You may reselect these groups by pressing the numbers, e.g. SHIFT 1 will create group 1, SHIFT 2 group 2. If you press 1, then group 1 will be selected. Flagships can be equipped with rockets that are quite useful against other spaceships, and bombs that can be used to bombard planetary defense systems. Since flagships are the only spaceships capable of carrying ground forces, one way to stop attempts to invade your colonies is to destroy the flagships before they reach your planet. Once all the flagships are destroyed, the ground forces they possessed will also have been disposed of.</entry>

  <entry key='database.moral_boosting'>Improving colony morale</entry>
  <entry key='database.moral_boosting.details'>On all of the colonies, morale affects your population, growth and tax income. On human colonies, there are special buildings that increase morale, such as the Bar, Recreation Center, Park, Church and Stadium. It is up to you to discover the most effective way to increase morale. Taxation morale can also be raised by building Police Stations.
	Morale does not change rapidly and you may have to wait some time for your actions to take effect. Morale can also be increased by lowering tax for a while, and then increasing it slightly when the morale level is stable.
	On alien colonies, you cannot build parks or other &quot;morale-increasing&quot; buildings, but the police will help you. When you take over another race&#39;s colony, the alien population will hate you. Lowering their tax and building police stations to maintain order will change their attitude. Bear in mind, that morale does not change quickly.</entry>

  <entry key='database.repair_colony_buildings'>Repairing colony buildings</entry>
  <entry key='database.repair_colony_buildings.details'>On colonies, damaged buildings become less effective, e.g. If a Food farm is damaged, people will get less food, morale will drop and eventually your tax level will decrease. You may repair buildings by clicking on them, a panel will open at the top-right corner. If you click on the damage % icon, it will change to repair %. If a building is being repaired, you will see the damage number on it flashing as the repair is being done and the damage percentage decreasing.</entry>
  <entry key='database.research_labs'>Role of development centers</entry>
  <entry key='database.research_labs.details'>Most research options are linked to technology levels. The technology levels are split into 5 areas: Civil Engineering, Mechanics, Computer Technology, Artificial Intelligence and Military Technology. Your capabilities in these five areas are determined by the type and number of Development Centers you have. Each planet you control may only have one development center so you will need to plan carefully in which area to increase. N.B. Your technology levels are only increased if the development centers you have are fully functioning.
	If a center has over 50% damage, or has no electricity/power the additional benefits will be lost. If you demolish a development center, your technology in that field will also decrease. This is how you can develop new inventions using your planets&#39; resources. If you have 1-Civil Engineering and 2-Military Dev.Centers, and need 2-Civil Engineering and 1-Military Dev.Center to create an invention, you can simply demolish one of your Military Dev.Centers and build a Civil Engineering center on that planet.</entry>
  <entry key='database.spaceship_equipping'>Equipping spaceships</entry>
  <entry key='database.spaceship_equipping.details'>Each Cruiser, Destroyer and Flagship can be equipped with several items. Fighters cannot be equipped with weapons or other equipment. The larger a ship is, the more equipment can be fitted. If you click on a ship from your fleet, it can be equipped in the right window, where the key equipment areas or bays are marked with a green square. Click on the green square, and you will be able to choose from the items you can add, e.g. if you have 10 laser 1.0 equipped and the maximum you can have is 14, click on the +1 button to add laser 1.0 from your stock to the equip bay. This way, you may add 4 more until the maximum amount is reached.
	You can use the equipment bays for the same type of weapons as well, e.g. if an equipped part of the ship has laser 1.0, and you have laser 2.0 in stock, you will first have to remove laser 1.0 from the equip bay in order to replace it with laser 2.0. This may require a bit of a work but it&#39;s well worth it. If your equipment pod has laser 1.0, that means you can use that space to add laser type weapons only. You cannot add radars or any other weapon type to the equipment pod that supports lasers.
	In order to equip items to your ship, you need to be near one of your planets which has a military spaceport built on it. This spaceport provides short range transfer ships which will transport the items from your stock pile to the spaceship and equip them. Some spaceships come with standard equipment, like hyperdrives. These come as standard with the ship. They cannot be removed and you cannot equip any other items to this bay.
	When your spaceship gets damaged, the equipment parts also sustain damage. In this instance the green squares representing the equipment pods will turn yellow for (medium damage) or red (heavy damage). When bays are damaged, the equipment in the bay is also damaged, e.g. you may lose equipped laser cannons due to sustained hits. That is why it is important to check your spaceship&#39;s equipment after battle. The damaged parts will repair after some time but if you lose weapons, you will need to re-equip them.</entry>
  <entry key='database.tax_income'>Tax income</entry>
  <entry key='database.tax_income.details'>Your finances depend solely on tax and trade income. Trade income is a long term investment, while tax income will be your main source of earning. Trade income gives you 600 credits/day, if you own a Traders space port. Trade Center creates an income of 1200 credits/day. If you have a bank on the colony, the bank will double all the trade income. Tax income depends on several factors:
	- the number of people living on the planet,
	- the taxation level (controlled by you),
	- taxation morale
	
	If the taxation level is high, (demanding and opressive) it is very likely that the population will be unhappy. The taxation morale will decrease and unrest will spread throughout the colony. On special occasions you may still use high taxation levels, but this cannot be used as a long term strategy. Taxation morale can be increased in several ways. Trade income does not depend on tax morale so it can be used effectively on alien planets to create a stable source of income. Keeping the taxes low will also make the inhabitants feel more secure.</entry>
