00:02.300-00:04.000 Captain! We are in trouble!
00:04.500-00:06.700 The prototype of our newly developed cruiser 
00:06.800-00:08.700 has been stolen by the Garthogs.
00:09.100-00:10.600 Reconissance believes that they'll be
00:10.700-00:12.200 passing through your sector.
00:13.000-00:15.100 They must not get that prototype!
00:15.300-00:17.000 You must succeed!
00:17.200-00:19.300 Your career may depend upon this.
