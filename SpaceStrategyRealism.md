I collect some points about space and realism problems here:

  * Sound effects in space battles or travel sounds.
  * Space is too big;
    * up to scale would visually problematic,
    * travel times huge,
    * easy to miss meeting points.
  * Faster Than Light;
    * without it, a journey within a solar system would take hours at least
    * if we consider acceleration/deceleration, that is even worse
    * relativity consideration, crew ages slower
    * going FTL: exotic matter, black-hole levels of energy to warp space-time
    * jump gates, wormholes to skip distances
  * Planets are huge
    * buildable area is huge, you could easily build billions of buildings
    * billions of inhabitants
    * all this times hundreds or thousands of habitable planets
  * Construction can take months or years instead of hours or days
  * Research takes months
    * Always going on on many fields
    * Could be focused -> Make fields more attractive by funding and researching something valuable has higher chance.
    * [Discovery dynamism](http://www.spacesector.com/blog/2009/07/dynamic-and-specialized-technology-research-in-space-strategy-games/)
      * But I don't like to be excluded from technologies -> given set of ground physics and mathematics, let the player set any research target, e.g., R&D me a tank with 20 DPS and 500 HP, etc.
  * Instant move of inventory
  * Instant commands across several lightyears?
