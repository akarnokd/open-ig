#summary AI related ideas and requirements

Just a bunch of rules, ideas, requirements to properly design a Hybrid GOAP system. The original game's AI behavior and algorithm is unknown. Probably it used some state machine and random task arbitration, along with cheating the planet and world simulations.

= Enemy attacking fleet detected =

Remark: Target is known from the fleet itself. Need to compensate the human player

== Targets a planet ==

Own fleet actions:
  # Intercept fleet in space
    * avoid meeting point over one of the enemies fleet
    * potentially meet over one of our planet with space ground defenses
  # Reinforce target planet in orbit
  # Use multiple fleets

Planet's actions:
  # Deploy tanks from inventory
    * and/or Produce if enough time
  # Deploy stations from inventory
    * if military spaceport available
      * build station if enough time
    * if no military spaceport available
      * (build stations and military spaceport) if enough time
  # Build more guns if enough time
  # Build a shield if enough time
  # Ensure there is enough power to the defenses
    * build power plant
    * turn off other buildings
