#summary Customizing a game

= Introduction =

Adding more customizable skirmish and campaign editor are planned features. 
Still, you can MOD your game, but currently it is complicated:

= Starting steps =
  * create a directory with the name "data"
  * extract the generic/skirmish/human from  open-ig-upgrade-NNNN-NN-NNA2.zip into the data directory. 
  * You should now have the following structure:
{{{
data/skirmish/human/definition.xml
data/skirmish/human/planets.xml
data/skirmish/human/players.xml
data/skirmish/human/scripting.xml
data/skirmish/human/tech.xml
}}}

  * rename skirmish/human to something else (e.g., human2)

{{{
data/skirmish/human2/definition.xml
data/skirmish/human2/planets.xml
data/skirmish/human2/players.xml
data/skirmish/human2/scripting.xml
data/skirmish/human2/tech.xml
}}}

= Setup other races =

  * open players.xml and create a copy of the "FreeNations" player. 
  * Change the values to another race. 
  * If you need examples, look for the generic/campaign/main2/players.xml file for valid settings
{{{
<player id='Garthog' race='garthog' name='players.garthog'
	icon='starmap/fleets/garthog_fleet'
	color='FFFC2828'
	picture='database/garthog'
	money='25000'
	initial-stance='40'
	colonization-limit='-1'
/>
}}}

= Setup starting planets =

  * open planets.xml and look for 3 planets near by (run a normal game CTRL+V on starmap then look for the names in a cluster). Add 

{{{ 
owner='Garthog' population='5000' race='garthog' 
}}}

to the planet node

= Change definition labels =

  * open definition.xml and change texts/title and texts/description something you would like to read on the single player screen.

= Finish =

  * Save and restart the program. You should now see your game.
