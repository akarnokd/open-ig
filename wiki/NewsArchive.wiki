  * Added ability to place buildings onto planets
  * Added building listing to the information screen
  * CTRL+C clears all buildings from the current planet, DEL deletes the selected building

May 20. 2009
  * Updated the AnimPlay application. Under the hood, now it uses the same method for rendering images and audio. Better yet, I've added 3 options to
    * save the animation as an animated GIF file,
    * save a series of PNG files containing every frame
    * save the animation sound as a WAV file

May 18. 2009

  * Released version 0.67. Major enhancements:
    * Display planets, colony info, fleets on the information panel
    * Planet/Colony button displays the appropriate surface type and variant of the selected planet
    * CTRL+. to toggle between default/neighbor/bilinear/bicubic interpolation of the starmap background
  * Added screenshots of the new screens

May 4. 2009
  * Updated the Wiki pages.
  * Progress is slower than I expected. Creating a good and solid data model supporting skirmish, campaign and multiplayer is hard. But I uploaded the 0.6 version, which includes some style and bug fixes. 
  * Planet surface rendering is now correctly displaying multi-tile elements. Added the original campaign's ~100 planets with radar enabled. I also added the open source [http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/ JOrbis] OGG player library. I had to slightly modify its source code to adhere the checkstyle rules used in the project and removed lots of unused codes from it. When the application will support custom campaigns, it will allow custom music/sound playback from .ogg or .wav files.

  * Created a package for the newest version of the program. Now, along with the JAR file, I've put the source code into a ZIP file. As the program evolves, unfortunately, the default 64 MB memory for double-clicked JAR programs becomes too sort. There are several options:
    * Create/use a command line script with -Xmx128M parameter
    * Change the JAR file extension assignment and include the -Xmx128M parameter

  * Thanks to Open-IG and a new wide screen monitor, I was able to find two bugs in the latest JDK regarding the new D3D rendering. See http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6801614 and http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6804860 for further details as soon as they are available.

  * Due some strange rendering behavior in 6u11 I strongly advise to use 6u7 on Windows for running Open-IG. The strange rendering occurs when the game windows are resized to a very large size (>1500 pixels). On these resolutions, the graphics gets misplaced, the dotted lines get garbled. Possible reason might be in the new D3D rendering pipeline (or just my videocard driver is too old).

January 28. 2009

  * Made some enhancements in audio, screen switching and on information screen.

January 19. 2009

  * Updated the !AnimPlay utility. Now it allows to stop the playback, and resize the playback window.

January 18. 2009

  * Fixed some minor issues in the !AnimPlay utility.
  * Created a demonstration application to show the current state of the game.
