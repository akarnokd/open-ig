= Introduction =
Open-IG is an open source Java^TM^ clone of the [http://www.digitalreality.hu Digital Reality] game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_Galactica Imperium Galactica], a popular real time space strategy game developed around 1997 in Hungary. Open-IG attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features. It needs the original Imperium Galactica files to run.

Open-IG is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The project is currently in a very early stage of development, mostly I spent time to decipher the game's resource files. For more information please see the [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Questions Questions and answers] page.

= Installation =

Install Java JRE/JDK 1.6.X (preferrably X >= 10). Copy the contents of the original Imperium Galactica CD1 and CD2 into one directory (duplicate files can be simply overwritten). Put the (yet to come) {{{open-ig.jar}}} file into that directory. Double click on this file or use the command line {{{java -jar open-ig.jar}}}

= Documentation =

See the [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Main main] wiki page.

= Development =

Currently, not much info can I provide.

== Developer resources ==

  * [PAC_Format PAC file format] specification
  * [ANI_Format ANI file format] specification
  * [Custom_LZSS LZSS decompression algorithm] used in the ANI files
  * [Custom_RLE RLE decompression algorithm] used in the ANI files

= Tools =

The Open-IG will play the original game's ANI files. To play these files separately, please use the [http://open-ig.googlecode.com/files/animplay-0.1.jar AnimPlay] utility. Double click on this file or use the command line {{{java -jar animplay-0.1.jar}}}. The utility will allow you to select a file to play. 
(The source code is available from the SVN.)
