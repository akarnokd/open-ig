= Introduction =
Open-IG is an open source Java^TM^ clone of the [http://www.digitalreality.hu Digital Reality] game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_Galactica Imperium Galactica], a popular real time space strategy game developed around 1997 in Hungary. Open-IG attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features. It needs the original Imperium Galactica files to run.

Open-IG is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The project is currently in a very early stage of development, mostly I spent time to decipher the game's resource files. For more information please see the [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Questions Questions and answers] page.

= Installation =

Install Java JRE/JDK 1.6.X (preferrably X >= 10). Copy the contents of the original Imperium Galactica CD1 and CD2 into one directory (duplicate files can be simply overwritten). Put the {{{open-ig-0.6.jar}}} file into that directory. Note that the application requires at least 128 MB of memory. You can use the -Xmx command line parameter or change the .jar file extension assignment settings in your operating system to include it. To run the game double click on this file or use the command line 

{{{java -Xmx128M -jar open-ig-0.6.jar}}}

 If you don't want to put the JAR with the game files, you could use an extra command line parameter to specify the home of the IG files: 

{{{java -Xmx128M -jar open-ig-0.6.jar c:\games\ig\}}}


Please see the [Documentation documentation] page for what can you do within the application at the moment.

= Development =

Currently, not much info can I provide.

== Developer resources ==

  * [PAC_Format PAC file format] specification
  * [ANI_Format ANI file format] specification
  * [Custom_LZSS LZSS decompression algorithm] used in the ANI files
  * [Custom_RLE RLE decompression algorithm] used in the ANI files

= Tools =

The Open-IG will play the original game's ANI files. To play these files separately, please use the [http://open-ig.googlecode.com/files/animplay-0.3.jar AnimPlay] utility. Double click on this file or use the command line {{{java -jar animplay-0.3.jar}}}. The utility will allow you to select a file to play. 
(The source code is available from the SVN.)

== External tools ==

There exist an unpacker for the game PAC files. You can downoad it from [http://bgafc.t-hosting.hu/data/ig1pac_h.exe here].
