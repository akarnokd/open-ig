= Introduction =

This page lists tasks that I want to complete with expected times.


|| *Task* || *ETA* || *Status* || *Remarks* ||
|| Build a testbed for further screen developments || 2011-02-13 || - || Going through the entire menu for testing a screen is cumbersome and the current way of developing outside the game's context is ineffective. I want to create a fast environment to test out new screens and integrate the finished screens with the main game with less effort. ||
|| Screen: Equipment || 2011-02-27 || - || This screen has multiple modes: equip/unequip fleets, merge and combine fleets. ||

|| Screen: Diplomacy || 2011-04-10 || - || I need to run the original game to figure out the available talk options. ||
|| Screen: Database || 2011-04-17 || - || I have a test implementation, but I'm not satisfied with its behavior. ||
|| Screen: Bar || 2011-04-24 || - || Test implementation exists, only integration is required. ||
