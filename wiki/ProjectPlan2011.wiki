= Introduction =

This page lists tasks that I want to complete with expected times.

= Plans =

|| *Task* || *Expected completion time* || *Status* || *Remarks* ||
|| Build a testbed for further screen developments || 2011-02-13 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Going through the entire menu for testing a screen is cumbersome and the current way of developing outside the game's context is ineffective. I want to create a fast environment to test out new screens and integrate the finished screens with the main game with less effort. ||
|| Control composition || 2011-02-28 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Build a composable mini GUI framework ||
|| Screen: Equipment || 2011-03-06 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || This screen has multiple modes: equip/unequip fleets, merge and combine fleets. _Update_: need for better UI and event composition first. *v0.84* ||
|| Screen: Research & Production || 2011-03-13 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || The research and production are 50% the same. *v0.85*||
|| Screen: Colony || 2011-04-03 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Integrate properly with the main game, add controls. Transform all old planets via the map editor. *v0.86* ||
|| Screen: Information || 2011-04-03 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || It contains 8 different tabs with different content and behavior. *v0.87* ||
|| Screen: Bar || 2011-04-10 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Test implementation exists, only integration is required. *v0.89* ||
|| Screen: Database || 2011-04-10 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || I have a test implementation, but I'm not satisfied with its behavior. *v0.89* ||
|| Screen: Statistics & Achievements || 2011-04-17 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Polish the current implementation, its look and behavior. *v0.89* ||
|| Basic simulation || 2011-05-15 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Time elapse, running research and production, fleet movements. Gather achievements and statistics. No enemies. *v0.87* ||
|| Screen: Equipment || 2011-04-17 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Finish the Equipment screen. *v0.90* ||
|| Screen: Save, Load & Options || 2011-04-17 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Will come in handy when testing. *v0.91* ||
|| Screen: Test || 2011-04-24 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || A very simple screen for the test questions. *0.91* ||
|| Screen: Credits || 2011-04-24 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || A simple scrolling credits. *v0.91* ||
|| Sound & Music integration || 2011-04-24 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Add sound and music, add statusbar notification and message history. *v0.91* music deferred. ||
|| Music || 2011-07-17 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/loading.gif || Add music ||

|| Surface & Space battles || 2011-07-17 || - || Rendering and basic simulation ||
|| Create the Artifical Intelligence || 2011-08-15 || - || This is going to be a real challenge. ||
|| Scripting for campaign || 2011-08-21 || - || Build a scriptable campaign engine. We will use the internal !JavaScript support. ||
|| Beta release || 2011-09-04 || - || Code and resource cleanup, documentation creation cleanup here on Google Code, downloads section cleanup. ||
|| Multiplayer || 2011-11-13 || - || Multiplayer will be like a remote control: receive status changes and submit commands to the host. Human vs. Human with some technology tree simplifications (e.g., build colony ship from start). ||
|| Android version || 2011-12-31 || - || Create a port for the single player part to Android 2.2+ devices. The interface, however, will be redesigned and restructured for those devices with smaller screen and touch based input. ||

= TODO =

List of things that need fixing, but without any due date other than hopefully the beta release

|| *Issue* || *Notes* ||
|| Missing lightmap for many buildings || The original game doesn't seem to have them, need to manually create. ||
|| Research & Production category labels is hard to read || The unselected versions in hungarian and english both are ugly. ||
|| Create a better launcher || The current version looks a bit ugly - apply more IG style and fix some functional inconsistencies (e.g., if there is a new version, you cannot start the current version unless you upgrade). Add launch alternatives, better download handling, etc. ||
|| ~~Add building upgrade UI to the colony screen~~ || ~~I need to find room on the colony screen.~~ ||
|| ~~Add issue icons to the colony screen~~ || ~~Similar to 0.72 feature.~~ ||
|| Add scrollbars to the starmap screen || I use the right-button pan all the time. ||
|| Create XSD's for the XML files || They should become relatively stable now. ||
|| Create a Campaign editor || More convenient than editing XMLs ||
|| Make the population growth planet-type dependant || Currently, its constant. Need to figure out the percentage rules for all races ||
