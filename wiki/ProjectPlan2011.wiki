= Introduction =

This page lists tasks that I want to complete with expected times.


|| *Task* || *Expected completion time* || *Status* || *Remarks* ||
|| Build a testbed for further screen developments || 2011-02-13 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Going through the entire menu for testing a screen is cumbersome and the current way of developing outside the game's context is ineffective. I want to create a fast environment to test out new screens and integrate the finished screens with the main game with less effort. ||
|| Control composition || 2011-02-28 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/ok.png || Build a composable mini GUI framework ||
|| Screen: Equipment || 2011-03-06 || http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/src/hu/openig/gfx/loading.gif || This screen has multiple modes: equip/unequip fleets, merge and combine fleets. _Update_: need for better UI and event composition first. ||
|| Screen: Research & Production || 2011-03-13 || - || The research and production are 50% the same. ||
|| Screen: Colony || 2011-03-27 || - || Integrate properly with the main game, add controls. Transform all old planets via the map editor. ||

|| Screen: Bar || 2011-04-24 || - || Test implementation exists, only integration is required. ||
