= Introduction =

This page lists tasks that I want to complete with expected times.


|| *Task* || *ETA* || *Status* || *Remarks* ||
|| Build a testbed for further screen developments || 2011&#8209;02&#8209;13 || - || Going through the entire menu for testing a screen is cumbersome and the current way of developing outside the game's context is ineffective. I want to create a fast environment to test out new screens and integrate the finished screens with the main game with less effort. ||
|| Screen: Equipment || 2011&#8209;02&#8209;27 || - || This screen has multiple modes: equip/unequip fleets, merge and combine fleets. ||
|| Screen: Research &amp; Production || 2011&#8209;03&#8209;13 || - || The research and production are 50% the same. ||
|| Screen: Colony || 2011&#8209;03&#8209;27 || - || Integrate properly with the main game, add controls. Transform all old planets via the map editor. ||
|| Screen: Information || 2011&#8209;04&#8209;03 || - || It contains 8 different tabs with different content and behavior. ||
|| Screen: Diplomacy || 2011&#8209;04&#8209;10 || - || I need to run the original game to figure out the available talk options. ||
|| Screen: Database || 2011&#8209;04&#8209;17 || - || I have a test implementation, but I'm not satisfied with its behavior. ||
|| Screen: Bar || 201&#8209;04&#8209;24 || - || Test implementation exists, only integration is required. ||
|| Screen: Statistics &amp; Achievements || 2011&#8209;04&#8209;24 || - || Polish the current implementation, its look and behavior. ||
|| Basic simulation || 2011&#8209;05&#8209;15 || - || Time elapse, running research and production, fleet movements. Gather achievements and statistics. No enemies. ||
