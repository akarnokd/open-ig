#summary Specialities of the original game
= Introduction =

This page collects the strange properties of the original game I discovered.


= Details =

|| *Property* || *Resolution in Open-IG* ||
|| Ion Gun for the Morgath empire has bad width/height || Uses the correct width/height derived from the actual image tile ||
|| Significant amount of the building image has height greater than the actual tile, causing a transparent bottom part || Introduced a vertical offset parameter to shift down the image ||
|| On San Sterling, the Colony Hub is placed actually on an unbuildable region || Open-IG enforces strictly the buildability region, but the rendering allows the placement of buildings everywhere. The default building deployment of San Sterling is simply forced. Note that if the player looses the Colony hub there, he/she won't be able to build it back on the same area ||
|| On Center 4, the pack of Military spaceport, Civil Dev Center and Radar 2.0 were built on an unbuildable tile || Deployed the buildings around the obstacle ||
|| Planetary Shield 2 for the Sullep Empire has bad width/height || Using correct width/height ||
|| Exterior 11 of the Sullep Empire has two Colony hubs || Keep both for now ||
|| Outer 7 of the Dargslans has Colony Hub on an unbuildable area || Manually force building placement ||
|| Center 7 of the Free Traders has Colony hub, Mechanics Dev and Nuclear Plant on an unbuildable area || Manually force building placement ||
|| Magellan 6 of the Free nations has Colony hub placed on an unbuildable area || Manually forced the building placement ||
|| Exterior 4 has several buildings placed on one another (reported by TCH) || Only the visible buildings where placed ||
|| Colonize undiscovered (open-ig: known but not by name) planets (from <a href='http://code.google.com/u/gharrach/'>gharrach</a>) and causing rendering anomalies due population race inequal to colonizing race || As of 0.71: the gameplay mechanic is undeveloped, I guess I'll add a check to the Colonize button to error: _this planet seems to be colonized_. In theory, Open-IG's planet surface renderer can display multiple race's buildings on the same planet as my map works differently (e.g surface basemap + building location map). I considered the ability to build those human buildings which are not available to the alien races. ||
|| Building limits (from <a href='http://code.google.com/u/gharrach/'>gharrach</a>) || The original unpatched game had 5000 building limit. Patch 1.2 lifted this but the DOS game could not address more than 64MB of RAM, still imposing an arbitrary limit of 100000 buildings. Open-IG has no limitation on the number of objects, but you might need to run the game with more JVM memory: 384MB for example. ||
|| Some planets contain mutliple research centers. (from <a href='http://code.google.com/u/gharrach/'>gharrach</a>) || This was a deliberate decision from the original developers. I double checked the Open-IG planets and only *Exterior 2* of the _Morgath Empire_ contains Statical and Mechanical centers at once. I remember seeing it on one of the Garthog planets, but somehow I didn't placed them - if someone could send me a screenshot, or better yet, use the OpenIG to build the appropriate buildings on a planet, then hit CTRL+S to save it in an XML, then mail me at gmail's akarnokd account. ||
|| There is a hack shown on <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQpZVCs-Ljc'>Youtube</a>. This allows the control of enemy vessels and order them to shoot at each other! || Definitely an unfixed bug or unhidden test cheat of the original game. It won't be in Open-IG that's for sure. ||
