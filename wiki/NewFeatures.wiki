= Introduction =

This page describes the newly added features of the Open Imperium Galactica. This includes graphical and game enhancements.


= Details =

== Planet status icons, taxation level ==

To allow easy management of planets the status icons have been introduced on various screens. These status icons allow the player to instantly recognize the problems with various planets.

Also, the starmap screen's information area contains the same icons. Also the taxation level is displayed in the population info line.

The planetary surface screen includes these icons along with the continuous display of the current planet.

The Open-IG utilizes the following icons to signal some errors:
|| *Icon* || *Description* ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/energy-icon-b.png || The planet has some energy issues ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/food-icon-b.png || The planet lacks food ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/hospital-icon-b.png || There are not enough hospitals ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/house-icon-b.png || The planet has not enough living space ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/worker-icon-b.png || There is not enough population to operate all buildings perfectly ||

== Colony info on the planet surface ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-colinfo-1.png

Displays all information available on the Colony info screen in a compact format. The semi-transparent panel can be toggled on/off by clicking on the bar right to it.

The status coloring is similar to the original game:
|| *Color* || *Description* ||
|| Green || Everything is OK ||
|| Yellow || The demand is higher than the available amount, but still less thant two times the available amount (e.g buildings can be operated at least 50%) ||
|| Red || The demand is more than twice the available amount ||

== Worker demand ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-workers-1.png

Displays the amount of demanded / available workers on a planet.

== Colony info problems ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-colprobl-1.png

The small planetary info area on various information screens now includes the list of problems on that planet. The coloring is the same as for the *Colony info on the planet surface* above, except the OK cases are not listed

== Problematic planet highlight on the Planets info page ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-blink-1.png

Planet names with any problem blinks on the Planets information page.

== Customizable energy and worker allocation ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-alloc-1.png

In the original game, if there was a worker or energy shortage, the game automatically distributed the available resources equally among buildings, resulting in the same operation level for every one. This allocation strategy might be sub-optimal in various cases. Therefore, new and selectable strategies have been introduced as follows:

|| *Name* || *Description* ||
|| Uniform || The original game strategy, evaluates the supply percentage for everyone by available/demand ||
|| Living conditions || Prefers life enhancing buildings (housing, entertainment, hospitals etc.). Boosts morale. ||
|| Production || Moves resources to the production buildings to maximize capacity in space, equipment and weapons factories ||
|| Science || Moves resources to scientific buildings to ensure research is not interrupted ||
|| Economy || Moves resources to the financial and economic buildings to maximize trade income ||
|| Military || Allocates resources to military and defensive buildings (barracks, radars, guns, shields, etc.) to maximize defensive capability of the planet ||
|| Operation || Uses heuristic approach to maximize the number of operational buildings on the planet. ||

== Fleet firepower ==

Beneath the fleet speed value, the current firepower is displayed for the currently selected fleet. Later on, it might be possible to see the enemy fleet's firepower if it is in the range of any Radar3.

== Player planet listing on starmap ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-planets-1.png

Due the resizable window of Open-IG, the space gained by resizing the starmap vertically allows to display and choose from a list of planets instead of just one planet name.
