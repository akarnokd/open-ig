To allow easy management of planets the status icons have been introduced on various screens. These status icons allow the player to instantly recognize the problems with various planets.

Also, the starmap screen's information area contains the same icons.

The planetary surface screen includes these icons along with the continuous display of the current planet.

The Open-IG utilizes the following icons to signal some errors:
|| *Icon* || *Description* ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/energy-icon-b.png || The planet has some energy issues ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/food-icon-b.png || The planet lacks food ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/hospital-icon-b.png || There are not enough hospitals ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/house-icon-b.png || The planet has not enough living space ||
|| http://karnokd.uw.hu/worker-icon-b.png || There is not enough population to operate all buildings perfectly ||

== Colony info on the planet surface ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-colinfo-1.png

Displays all information available on the Colony info screen in a compact format. The semi-transparent panel can be toggled on/off by clicking on the bar right to it.

The status coloring is similar to the original game:
|| *Color* || *Description* ||
|| Green || Everything is OK ||
|| Yellow || The demand is higher than the available amount, but still less thant two times the available amount (e.g buildings can be operated at least 50%) ||
|| Red || The demand is more than twice the available amount ||

== Worker demand ==

http://karnokd.uw.hu/feat-workers-1.png

Displays the amount of demanded / available workers on a planet.

== Colony info problems ==

The small planetary info area on various information screens now includes the list of problems on that planet. The coloring is the same as for the *Colony info on the planet surface* above, except the OK cases are not listed

== Problematic planet highlight on the Planets info page ==
