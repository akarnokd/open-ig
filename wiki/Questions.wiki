= Introduction =

I collected some (not yet frequently asked) questions and answers about the Open-IG project.

= Questions & Answers =

=== Why did you start this project? ===
Recently I pulled my old Imperium Galactica game and played with it using DOSBox. I noticed the age of this game, how the 640x480 resolution was too small and how unresponsive it worked. I figured out that maybe I could create a resizable game 
interface. Luckily, the images, sound and animation is present, therefore I just need to create the engine to play it.

=== Where did the inspiration came from? ===
My another old-time favorite is Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe, which started out as a modern time version of the old DOS program. Luckily, the rendering in Imperium Galactica much simpler.

=== Why Java? ===
I'm a Java developer so it was a simple decision. As a side effect, the Open-IG will be playable on any platform which supports the recent versions of Java.

=== When will we see the source? ===
Soon. Unfortunately, the current source code is used to do some proof-of-concept rendering and game resource analysis. It has hand coded filenames and undocumented functions. They don't suit the format of a proper open source project yet.
