*Open Imperium Galactica* (Open-IG) is an open source [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html Java]^TM^ reimplementation of the [http://www.digitalreality.hu Digital Reality] game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperium_Galactica Imperium Galactica], a popular real time space strategy game developed around 1996 in Hungary. 

Open-IG attempts to reproduce the feel of the original game while fixing many bugs, inconsistencies and extending it with new features, however, it does not aim for producing an exact, behavior perfect and pixel perfect replica. 

The project contains all necessary files to run the Open Imperium Galactica standalone: there is no need for the original game's files.
