  # build phase

The {{{Building.buildProgress}}} defines the current buildup level. It goes from 0 to {{{Building.type.hitpoints}}} with a build speed constant {{{Building.BUILD_SPEED}}} per game seconds.

Uncertain: {{{Building.type.hitpoints}}} equals to {{{Building.type.cost}}}?

During buildup, the surface map displays the scaffolding tiles for the particular {{{Building.techId}}}.
