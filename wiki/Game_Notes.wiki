= Introduction =

This page describes the differences between released versions of the Open Imperium Galactica Game (open-ig-xxx.jar)

= Version 0.92 - Music, achievements, diplomacy =
  * Released: TBD
  * Removed upgrade options from Church, Bar, Recreation Center, Park, Stadium, Civil Lab, Mechanical Lab, Computer Lab, AI Lab and Military Lab. When you load a save, these buildings will return to their non-upgraded status (without money reclaim).
  * Decreased the morale boosting effect of Police stations where the owner race is the same as the population race.
  * Added time-to-live options to planetary inventory where satellites reside. 
    * If a planet does not have any radar building or Hubble2 satellite, the satellites of other races may remain there forever. 
    * Time-to-live is defined in 10s of game minutes; Survey satellite = 12 hours, Spy satellite = 24 hours, Spy satellite 2 = 96 hours.
    * The better radar is available to the planet the faster it discovers a radar, e.g., a planet with hubble 2 (radar = 4) and an enemy survey satellite (12 hours) will be discovered within 3 hours.
  * Improvements to the Load/Save screen to use a smaller XML file for the list of available saves which will reduce the population time for longer lists. Previously existing saves will become a companion XML on the next screen display.
  * The Main Menu button is now hidden on the settings part of the load/save screen to avoid accidentally leaving the game instead of returning to the previous screen.
  * ...

    * *New:* Computer voice is fun but only for a few hours. After that, it becomes annoying.

    * *New:* Right click on this bar to show the [http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/doc/message_history_screen_menu.png message history]. The history shows the event text, an icon and the game time when it happened. You may double click on any item to go to its target if applicable. You can hide the list by right clicking on the statusbar again. You may use the mouse scroll wheel over the list.
  * Gameplay changes:

    * You may only build 1 Water vaporator per planet but gives you +10 morale.

    * You may now return to the Main menu to start a new game instead of relaunching the application
  * The old setup screen is now hidden. Will be replaced by the new ingame Settings screen mentioned before.
