= Map Editor Version 0.1 Introduction =

The aim of this Map Editor program is to help convert the original surface and building maps convert to a version used by Open IG v0.8 and above. In addition, the tool allows creating completely new and mixed surface maps and building layouts for any further custom games. The third role is to help me develop the new planet surface rendering module.

= System Requirements =

  * Java JRE version 6 or later (Java 7 preferred, see https://jdk7.dev.java.net/ ).
  * 384 MB of memory (512 MB or more preferred)
  * 3MB disk space for the pack, 1.2 GB for the Open-IG resource files.

= Installation =

  * Download the JAR file and place it where the other Open-IG ZIP files are located. (See [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Install_Instructions_08 Install Instructions] for details on the resource files)
  * Download any {{{open-ig-upgrade-*.zip}}} files
  * Delete the {{{open-ig-config.xml}}} file
  * Run the MapEditor by double clicking on its JAR file, or from command line: {{{java -Xmx512M -jar open-ig-mapeditor-0.1.jar}}}

= Usage =

In version 0.1 there is two option to start editing a map.

== Creating a new empty map ==

From *File* menu select *New...*. This will create a 66 x 33 map comparable to the size of the original maps in Imperium Galactica.

== Import existing ==

From *File* menu select *Import...*.

The dialog gives two main options:

  * You can import one of the original base map (see [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Surface_Maps Surface Maps] for details).
  * You can import one of the original planet with background and buildings (basically the version 0.72 map definitions from the earlier Open-IG).

The *Original map* lists the surface type and the filename of the surface variant. The *Original planets* lists the original planets ordered by name along with the surface type and the current race that owns the planet.

The *Shift X* and *Shift Y* options allow the user to place the original map and/or buildings relative to their original coordinate system. In Open-IG 0.72 and before, coordinate system was using (0, 0) and (1, 0) respectively as the top-left corner. However, due performance and correctness issues, Open-IG 0.8 and later renders everything from (0, 0). To convert between the new and old location system, -1 must be applied to the original coordinates to place it fully visible on the newer map surface.
