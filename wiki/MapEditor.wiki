= Map Editor Version 0.1 Introduction =

The aim of this Map Editor program is to help convert the original surface and building maps convert to a version used by Open IG v0.8 and above. In addition, the tool allows creating completely new and mixed surface maps and building layouts for any further custom games. The third role is to help me develop the new planet surface rendering module.

= System Requirements =

  * Java JRE version 6 or later (Java 7 preferred, see https://jdk7.dev.java.net/ ).
  * 384 MB of memory (512 MB or more preferred)
  * 3MB disk space for the pack, 1.2 GB for the Open-IG resource files.

= Installation =

  * Download the JAR file and place it where the other Open-IG ZIP files are located. (See [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Install_Instructions_08 Install Instructions] for details on the resource files)
  * Download any {{{open-ig-upgrade-*.zip}}} files
  * Delete the {{{open-ig-config.xml}}} file
  * Run the MapEditor by double clicking on its JAR file, or from command line: {{{java -Xmx512M -jar open-ig-mapeditor-0.1.jar}}}

= Usage =

In version 0.1 there is two option to start editing a map.

== Creating a new empty map ==

From *File* menu select *New...*. This will create a 66 x 33 map comparable to the size of the original maps in Imperium Galactica.

== Import existing ==

From *File* menu select *Import...*.

The dialog gives two main options:

  * You can import one of the original base map (see [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Surface_Maps Surface Maps] for details).
  * You can import one of the original planet with background and buildings (basically the version 0.72 map definitions from the earlier Open-IG).

The *Original map* lists the surface type and the filename of the surface variant. The *Original planets* lists the original planets ordered by name along with the surface type and the current race that owns the planet.

The *Shift X* and *Shift Y* options allow the user to place the original map and/or buildings relative to their original coordinate system. In Open-IG 0.72 and before, coordinate system was using (0, 0) and (1, 0) respectively as the top-left corner. However, due performance and correctness issues, Open-IG 0.8 and later renders everything from (0, 0). To convert between the new and old location system, -1 must be applied to the original coordinates to place it fully visible on the newer map surface.

The *Replace current surface* lets the user clear any existing surface in the editor with the selected original surface or surface used in an original planet.

The *Replace existing buildings* lets the user replace any existing building placement with the buildings from the original planet. This might be useful to place buildings onto a custom-drawn background.

The *Replace surface along with building* options clears any existing feature and basically places the objects from the original map into the editor.

== Editor window components ==

The left side of the main editor window contains three sub-panels.

=== Preview panel ===

The topmost panel shows the currently selected building or surface object.

The red box around the image helps me spot offsetting errors within the image (e.g. a transparent line at its bottom, which distorts the rendering of the surface and creates holes).

The *Object placement mode* (Hotkey: *F3*) is a toggle button and switches between _selection mode_ (up) or _placement mode_ (down). In _selection mode_ the user can drag a selection box in the right editor panel and perform some bulk operations, for example delete everything in that box or fill it with a surface or building. In _placement mode_ the user can place surface features and buildings just like in the game one by one while clicking on the map position.
