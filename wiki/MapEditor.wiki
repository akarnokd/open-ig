= Map Editor Version 0.4 Introduction =

The aim of this Map Editor program is to help convert the original surface and building maps convert to a version used by Open IG v0.8 and above. In addition, the tool allows creating completely new and mixed surface maps and building layouts for any further custom games. The third role is to help me develop the new planet surface rendering module.

= System Requirements =

  * Java JRE version 6 or later (Java 7 preferred, see https://jdk7.dev.java.net/ ).
  * 384 MB of memory (512 MB or more preferred)
  * 3MB disk space for the pack, 1.2 GB for the Open-IG resource files.

= Installation =

  * Download the JAR file and place it where the other Open-IG ZIP files are located. (See [http://code.google.com/p/open-ig/wiki/Install_Instructions_08 Install Instructions] for details on the resource files)
  * Download any {{{open-ig-upgrade-*.zip}}} files
  * Delete the {{{open-ig-config.xml}}} file
  * Optionally: delete the {{{open-ig-mapeditor-config.xml}}} file
  * Run the MapEditor by double clicking on its JAR file, or from command line: {{{java -Xmx512M -jar open-ig-mapeditor-0.4.jar}}}

= Usage =


  
=== Mixed planets ===

The new rendering allows the placement of surface features and buildings from various types at once. You can create a half rocky, half snowy map with Garthog and Human buildings on it...

The only drawback is the type of the roads to apply. In the game, the planet's population race will always determine the type of the road graphics for simplicity. In the editor, the roads are rendered based on the last building's race that was placed on the surface.
