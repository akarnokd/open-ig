The purpose of the new Main Menu is to add new starting menu items beside the original 5 option. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to remove the imprinted, language dependent text completely, therefore, I added a semi-transparent black overlay where the new menu items will reside.

== Single player ==

This will lead to a new single player game selection window with the ability to select a campaign or skirmish game, difficulty and possibly other options. (Still in design)

=== Continue ===

Continue from the last save, if available

=== Load ===

Display the new loading screen. (Still in design)

== Multiplayer ==

Start or join to a multiplayer game. Details on how the multiplayer will work is still in consideration.

== Settings ==

It will display the Setup screen.
