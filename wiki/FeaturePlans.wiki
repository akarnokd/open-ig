= Introduction =

On this page, I collect ideas about enhancing the gameplay with more modern concepts, better management ways or nicer gameplay mechanics. Suggestions and comments welcome.


= Build any building on planets =

The current implementation resembles to the original game: there is a race per planet, and the building rendering is selected based on that information. It is possible to make this per building instance based (decoupling the strong connection between building and building prototype) to allow displaying buildings of different races at once.

I see two options:

  * Allow building anything everywhere (human and captured alien planets), for example, having a Human nuclear plant along with a Garthog nuclear plant. As they are equal in terms of parameters, this makes no sense other than visual niceness.
  * Allow building those human buildings, which are not available in the alien arsenal: e.g fusion plant, stadium, church. Of course, the it must be rectified why aliens would use a church? One drawback is that it is asymmetric for the alien races. If you play with alien races, you need to capture human colonies or other alien planets which contain human structures - hard to imagine.

= New tax income source: bars, recreation centers, stadions =

In the original game, building these structures had only effect on the morale (a thing I still need to think about). It feels natural, the more people use these buildings, the more income we should get as tax. It should directly increase the tax income per day based on a function yet to be designed (e.g function of population size, number of these buildings).

= Symmetric skirmish mode =

I already plan a skirmish mode, where you can unbounded conquer the galaxy - no hideous calls from the admiral or your wife! (plus testing the AI and other things is much easier in this mode :). However, the original game's technology tree is unbalanced and incomplete - missing buildings and ship types. I think it is possible to create a skirmish mode (using the tech.xml only, no actual change to the code is needed) to use the common subset for all aliens and humans (or perhaps, keep all the human vessels but scale their power to equal to the others?).

= New experience management =

The original game had a practically useless feature: the more enemies your ships destroyed, the more experience they gathered - improving their properties (exactly how exactly). I want to keep this experience aquisition but have a more usable and RPG-ish style.

First of all, Introduce an experience pool. You can then assign and unassign experience to/from your ships at will. If you upgrade your fleet, you unassign the current XP, then assign it to the new vessels. We can conceptionalize it as not moving XP, but rather moving the experienced crew between ships... :)

The second thing is how XP should (did in original game) affect the ship properties. I see some options:

  * Have it alter the firepower of the ship based on its value (probably a degressive function, e.g. logarithmic)
  * Have it alter all the ships properties together / on different scale: firepower, shields, hull, movement.
  * Have fixed slot of enhancement options per type / slot and have a fixed effect on them. Maybe even name them or have a Mass Effect style enhancement: one after one, with some special mid elements
    * Movement speed
    * Rotation speed
    * Lasers (power, range)
    * Cannons (power, range)
    * Rockets
    * Bombs
    * Shields
    * ECMs (range)
    * Hull

For example, Hull enhancement points can go to:

  +5% -> +10% -> +25% -> Regenerativity +5% -> +30% -> +50% -> Regenerativity + 10% -> +75% -> +90% -> +100% -> Regenerativity +25%

Where regenerativity means hull integrity regeneration rate on a time unit.

I think, there is a lot of room on the equimpent screen to have UI for this. Perhaps a tabbed panel on the right side where currently you can equip / unequip a medium or large ship. 

The subsystem enhancement concept, however, is too strong to allow it to be unassigned. We will only know when the first real tests and usage patterns get fed back.

= Badge/Achievement system =

The game is full of statistics: number of planets, income, power production, enemies destroyed, etc. I want to add some achievements for making progress in the game. Some ideas this far:

|| *Short name* || *Description* ||
|| Conqueror || Conquered the first enemy planet ||
|| Millionaire || You collected 1.000.000 credits ||
|| Student of Bokros || All your planets sustained the Oppressive taxation for a week ||
|| Pirate Bay || You lost a planet to the Pirates ||
|| Dargslayer || You eliminated all Dargslan from the galaxy ||
|| Energizer || Your total energy production reached 10.000.000 kW ||
|| Death Star || You left your colony to be destroyed ||
|| Resear assistant || You researched 5 technologies ||
|| Scientist || You researched 30 technologies ||
|| Nobel prize || You researched all technologies ||
|| Popular || All your colonies are happy with you ||
|| Happy clients of APEH || All your colonies have above 95% tax morale ||
|| Ultimate leader || All your colonies support you ||
|| Revolutioner || One of your colony has revolved ||
|| Mass effect || Your total population got above 1.000.000 ||
|| Defender of the crown || You successfully defended your colony ||
|| Embargo || You destroyed your first Trader ship ||
|| Colombus || You colonized your first planet ||
|| Quarter of the pie || You own 25 planets ||
|| Manufacturer || You produced a total of 1.000 items ||
|| Salvage || You destroyed 1.000 enemy ships ||
|| Living space || You discovered your first empty planet. ||
|| Food for thought || Your food production is above 1.000.000 ||
|| A decade in the service || You played 10 game years ||
|| Oldest man || You played 100 game years ||
|| All your base are belong to us || Your enemies captured one of your planets ||
|| E.T. exists || You discovered a non-human civilization ||
|| Defense contract || All your planets are equipped with at least 3 planetary guns and one shield. ||
|| Coffee break || You paused your game for 30 minutes ||
|| All seeing eye || At least 80% of the galaxy is covered by radar ||
|| Newbie || Started a new game ||
|| Commander || You have been promoted to commander ||
|| Admiral || You have been promoted to admiral ||
|| Grand Admiral || You have been promoted to grand admiral ||
|| Influenza no more || You successfully eliminated the source of the virus infection ||

Of course, the limits for numerical achievements can change, depending on how open-ig is played (e.g maybe 10M kW for the Energizer achievement is too low or too high for a normal play?)
