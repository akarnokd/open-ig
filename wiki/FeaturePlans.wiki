#summary Plans for enhancing the gameplay

= Introduction =

On this page, I collect ideas about enhancing the gameplay with more modern concepts, better management ways or nicer gameplay mechanics. Suggestions and comments welcome.


= Build any building on planets =

The current implementation resembles to the original game: there is a race per planet, and the building rendering is selected based on that information. It is possible to make this per building instance based (decoupling the strong connection between building and building prototype) to allow displaying buildings of different races at once.

I see two options:

  * Allow building anything everywhere (human and captured alien planets), for example, having a Human nuclear plant along with a Garthog nuclear plant. As they are equal in terms of parameters, this makes no sense other than visual niceness.
  * Allow building those human buildings, which are not available in the alien arsenal: e.g fusion plant, stadium, church. Of course, the it must be rectified why aliens would use a church? One drawback is that it is asymmetric for the alien races. If you play with alien races, you need to capture human colonies or other alien planets which contain human structures - hard to imagine.

= New tax income source: bars, recreation centers, stadions =

In the original game, building these structures had only effect on the morale (a thing I still need to think about). It feels natural, the more people use these buildings, the more income we should get as tax. It should directly increase the tax income per day based on a function yet to be designed (e.g function of population size, number of these buildings).

= Symmetric skirmish mode =

I already plan a skirmish mode, where you can unbounded conquer the galaxy - no hideous calls from the admiral or your wife! (plus testing the AI and other things is much easier in this mode :). However, the original game's technology tree is unbalanced and incomplete - missing buildings and ship types. I think it is possible to create a skirmish mode (using the tech.xml only, no actual change to the code is needed) to use the common subset for all aliens and humans (or perhaps, keep all the human vessels but scale their power to equal to the others?).

= New experience management =

The original game had a practically useless feature: the more enemies your ships destroyed, the more experience they gathered - improving their properties (exactly how exactly). I want to keep this experience aquisition but have a more usable and RPG-ish style.
