#summary PAC file format

= Introduction =

This page describes the package file format used by the original Imperium Galactica. The {{{hu.openig.utils.PACFile}}} class contains the routines to process a {{{.PAC}}} file.

= Details =

The file starts with a word, which specifies the number of entries (N) in the file. 

Following N x 20 bytes contains the directory listing for each internal file, size and offsets within the file:

|| *Offset* || *Description* ||
|| 00 || The length of the following file name, up to 13 bytes ||
|| 01 - 0D || The file name, unused bytes contain the dot (0x2E) characters ||
|| 0E - 0F || The length of the file ||
|| 10 - 13 || The absolute start offset within the file || 

Unfortunately, this file format does not allow storing files larger than 64KB. Therefore, lot of the building images are stored splitted into two separated files within a package.
The file format allows the file data to be non-contignous or not in the same order as the directory entries. The file is in little endian format.
