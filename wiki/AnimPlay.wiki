= Introduction =

My Open Imperium Galactica project started with the test whether I can come up with a decoder to play the original game's ANI files. I succeded, with the great help from TCH.

= Details =

With version 0.5 I added a playlist window, which can search any ANI files from the given directory. Note when you start the application, this window opens and starts scanning the files in the current directory and below. If you put the app into a root directory, it could take very long time before it finishes, and probably you can only kill the application (my mistake: haven't implemented a stop functionality to that.)

You can use the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd> keys to start playing the selected video (note, that ENTER behaves a bit excellish as it moves the selection to the next line and that entry will be played). You can use <kbd>S</kbd> to stop the current playback or <kbd>D</kbd> to replay the last playback.
