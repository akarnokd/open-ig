#summary Description of the installing and running of the Bar talks demo

= Introduction =

I've composed a small program to let people play with the four talks of the original Imperium Galactica. The downloadable file contains all resources needed and the original Imperium Galactica files are not required.

= Install & Run =

Download and extract the {{{talks-demo.zip}}} file into any suitable directory.

Double click on the {{{talks.jar}}} file or issue the following command line:

{{{java -jar talks.jar}}}

The program requires Java 6+ to run.

= Usage =

The *Talks* menu allows you to choose the person to talk with. You can change it when there are no active video playing.

The *Language* menu allows you to change the audio and subtitle language. The program defaults to hungarian.

Click on the yellow text to start the talk. Clicking while the video is playing will instantly go to the next talk choices. Some talks allow you to re-talk about a topic and topics already talked about will get a dark gray coloring.
