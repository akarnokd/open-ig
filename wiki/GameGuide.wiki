= Gameplay Tips =

  * Planetary accounting and statistics gathering are performed at midnight. Morale affecting factors such as shortages are considered exactly at this moment. Therefore, plan your building upgdares and reconstruction accordingly, i.e., do not start upgrading your Arcologies at 23:50, because you may get a massive morale loss due the temporary living space shortage.
  * If you have the money but not enough planets, you should start as many research as possible. They may not run to completion but you get a headstart.
  * If you want to place multiple buildings of the same type, hold SHIFT while placing a building.
  * Most listing offers the ability to scroll them via the mouse wheel. For example, you may scroll the building panel on the colony screen instead of clicking on the up or down button.

== Colony status icon ==

In order to help manage the colonies and their needs, status icons have been introduced. These icons are visible on the starmap, on the colony and on many information screen tabs. The following table summarizes these icons and their meaning.

== Building Upgrade System ==

The *new Building Upgrade System* has been introduced to solve two problems coming from the original game:

  * Allow the player to meet demands (energy, food, etc.) even when the current planet has no more building space.
  * Fix the issue with the random power-outputs of power plants: Open-IG uses a constant for power and upgrades multiply the output to meet the initial demands of the alien planets.

A new panel has been added to the colony screen under the existing building information panel:

http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/doc/open-ig-upgrade-panel.png

The user can click on the stars to upgrade a building to a certain level. You may only increase the upgrade level.

Not all buildings offer four levels of upgrade.

When an upgraded building is demolished, the upgrade level is considered: the player will receive the half of the total invested money.

The general rule for the upgrade system is that each level will increase the output, the energy and worker demand of the building. Three exceptional case exist:

  * Upgrading from Level 3 to Level 4 does not increase the energy and worker demand, but only the capacity.
  * Some buildings (e.g., Spaceship, Equipment, Weapons) increase capacity but their demands increase more rapidly: a necessary balance option.
  * Research centers do not increase their capacity, but instead, they reduce the energy and worker requirements: again, a necessary balance option.

== Research ==

The research mechanics probably differs from the original game's behavior (I couldn't figure it out).

Two independent factors are considered during the research.

  * Research time depends on the research cost and allocated money. The default research time is the Research Cost value in game minutes. You may assing between 1/4 and 2 times the research cost, which will increase or reduce the research time inversely. 

{{{
Research Time = (Research Cost / 10) / allocation multiplier
}}}

For example, a 6000 credit research would take 6000 game minutes. Game time advances in 10 minutes per step, and the screen displays 600 for convenience. On normal speed, this would take 600 seconds or 10 real minutes to complete. If you increase the research money to 12000, the research time decreases to 300 real seconds. If you decrease the money to 1500 credits, the research time jumps to 2400 seconds.

  * The research progress depends on the percent of required and available research labs, but more labs of any kind will not mean greater percent.

For example, a technology uses 1 civil and 1 mechanical development centers. If you have 0 civil and 1 mechanical centers, the research will progress up to 50% and stop there. If you have 0 civil and 2 mechanical centers, the research will still go up to 50%.

== Production ==

The production speed depends mainly on how many factories you have and what efficiency they operate. The production progress is proportional to this capacity. 

{{{
Production time = Cost * 50 / capacity
}}}

For example, you want to produce one fighter of cost 600 credits and you have 1000 spaceship capacity. The production will create a 20 credits worth of fighter per 10 ingame minutes, which translates to 30 real time seconds to complete a single fighter.

Of course, if the capacity would be 60000, it would construct 2 fighters per real time seconds.

== Construction & Upgrading ==

The construction has a simple mechanic. A building has a hitpoint value equal to its cost. The construction increased 200 hit points per 10 ingame minutes.

{{{
Construction time = Cost / 200
}}}

For example, constructing a colony hub of 40000 credits takes 200 seconds or 2000 ingame minutes (about 1 day and 9 hours).

If you upgrade a building. It will switch back to 25% of construction level and is inoperable until it reaches its 100% completion again.

== Repairing ==

The repairing mechanics has a twist. 

If you have a *Fire Brigade* on your planet, it will repair your buildings up to 50% health (or more, depending on the ugrade level of the Fire Brigade) for free. If you have a heavily damaged building and turn the repair on manually, it won't cost you money until it reaches this 50% health. Starting from 50%, it works as a regular repair.

The repair will improve 50 hitpoints for 20 credits per 10 ingame minutes. 

However, if the Fire Brigade is damaged itself, but still operational, it will only repair a proportion of this 50 hitpoints for free (at least 25 hitpoints, because it is the 50% efficiency mark). 

Regular repair is always fixing 50 hipoints per turn.

The options screen features an option to automatically repair damaged buildings, therefore, you don't need to manually turn repairs on and off for each and every building. You may set a minimum required money amount for the automatic repair on this screen as well. This limit may help in resource constrained times when you want to preserve money for other tasks and not let the auto-repair drain your money.

== Auto-Build ==

One of the old game's nasty property was that it became really tedious to manage a more than 20 planet empire later on within the game. Imperium Galactica 2 made improvements on this by introducing an auto-build feature. This feature removed the burden of micromanage the planets whenever they report a food or hospital shortage.

Therefore, a similar auto-build has been introduced into Open Imperium Galactica. You can toggle the auto-build on the colony information screen by clicking on the label. You can hold down the SHIFT key while clicking on the label to set the state on all of your planets.

The build strategy is as follows:
  * If a construction or worker shortage is present on the planet, do nothing. The first constraint prevents building indefinitely due the lack of statistical evidence. The second one is a heuristic, because if a planet suffers from worker shortage, adding another building would usually make things worse (less men to operate more buildings, some may fall below the 50% operation limit, causing even more shortages).
  * Handle energy shortages first, and don't handle other shortages yet. Usually, the root cause of a shortage may be simply the lack of energy.
  * Handle other shortages later but simultaneously.
  * Upgrade first, construct second: space is limited, and in long term, using the upgrade path reserves more space for later problems.
  * Upgrade multiple levels if the player has 30 times the required cost, upgrade a single level otherwise.
  * Try upgrading or constructing expensive buildings first.
  * If a new construction is required, consider the available build space. For example: if you could afford an Arcology but you only have room for Prefab housing, the auto-build will choose the latter.

The downside of the auto-build is that it may hold your overall progress back in the early game time where your biggest shortage will be the money.

To avoid unnecessary draining of credits by the auto-build feature, you can set the auto-build money limit in the options / gameplay page. This limit won't let the auto-build proceed if you have less than the specified money. The feature can be used to ensure the auto-build always chooses the most expensive (and most effective) buildings, basically "waiting" until you gather enough money to build them, and not building the cheapest one due money shortage.

== Satellite survival ==

Placing satellites around alien and enemy planets will take their attention sooner or later and destroy it. The same is true for alien satellites around the planets you own.

The better radar a planet has the faster satellites will be detected. The following table displays the survival time (ingame minutes) for each satellite and radar type:

|| *Satellite* || *No radar* || *Radar 1.0* || *Radar 2.0* || *Radar 3.0* || *Hubble 2* ||
|| Satellite || infinite || 12 hours || 6 hours || 4 hours || 3 hours ||
|| Spy Satellite 1 || infinite || 24 hours || 12 hours || 8 hours || 6 hours ||
|| Spy Satellite 2 || infinite || 96 hours || 48 hours || 32 hours || 24 hours ||

*Hubble 2* orbital radars placed around neighboring planets won't detect the devices if the target planet has no radar by itself (_you could say, they are much smaller than a fleet to be detectable_). 

_I'm not sure whether the original game had any sanction for these satellites in terms of diplomatic relations, because there was no way to recall the devices. In the current version, they are just destroyed._

== Earthquake ==

Earthquakes may happen on Earth-like or Rocky planets last *60 ingame minutes* (so you might catch it and see the shaking :). Earthquake affects buildings by reducing their hitpoints. The amount of hitpoints reduced depends on the building type:

  * For energy producing buildings, the earthquake reduces their status by 20% of their total hitpoints. For example, a Nuclear Plant having 8000 points will be reduced to 6400 points.
  * Factory buildings loose 15% of their total hitpoints.
  * Other buildings take 10% damage, e.g., a Colony hub of 40000 points will be reduced to 36000 points.

Earthquakes will affect the late gameplay (currently, after 6 real hours) and its occurrence is governed by the difficulty level:

  * EASY: 1 / year
  * NORMAL: 2 / year
  * HARD: 4 / year

When an earthquake happens, the player is notified and double clicking on the bottom status bar should bring up the colony affected. 

It is possible, that unattended planets might be completely destroyed by earthquakes.

_Depending on playtester's response, the mechanics might change. Having earthquakes tear down the initial colonies at the start might be too much._
