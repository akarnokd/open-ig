  * Planetary accounting and statistics gathering are performed at midnight. Morale affecting factors such as shortages are considered exactly at this moment. Therefore, plan your building upgdares and reconstruction accordingly, i.e., do not start upgrading your Arcologies at 23:50, because you may get a massive morale loss due the temporary living space shortage.
  * If you have the money but not enough planets, you should start as many research as possible. They may not run to completion but you get a headstart.

== Colony status icon ==

In order to help manage the colonies and their needs, status icons have been introduced. These icons are visible on the starmap, on the colony and on many information screen tabs. The following table summarizes these icons and their meaning.

<table border='1'>
<tr><td><b>Icon</b></td><td>Description</td></tr>

== Building Upgrade System ==

The *new Building Upgrade System* has been introduced to solve two problems coming from the original game:

  * Allow the player to meet demands (energy, food, etc.) even when the current planet has no more building space.
  * Fix the issue with the random power-outputs of power plants: Open-IG uses a constant for power and upgrades multiply the output to meet the initial demands of the alien planets.

A new panel has been added to the colony screen under the existing building information panel:

http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/doc/open-ig-upgrade-panel.png

The user can click on the stars to upgrade a building to a certain level. You may only increase the upgrade level.

Not all buildings offer four levels of upgrade.

When an upgraded building is demolished, the upgrade level is considered: the player will receive the half of the total invested money.

The general rule for the upgrade system is that each level will increase the output, the energy and worker demand of the building. Three exceptional case exist:

  * Upgrading from Level 3 to Level 4 does not increase the energy and worker demand, but only the capacity.
  * Some buildings (e.g., Spaceship, Equipment, Weapons) increase capacity but their demands increase more rapidly: a necessary balance option.
  * Research centers do not increase their capacity, but instead, they reduce the energy and worker requirements: again, a necessary balance option.

== Research ==

The research mechanics probably differs from the original game's behavior (I couldn't figure it out).

Two independent factors are considered during the research.

  * Research time depends on the research cost and allocated money. The default research time is the Research Cost value in game minutes. You may assing between 1/4 and 2 times the research cost, which will increase or reduce the research time inversely. 

{{{
Research Time = (Research Cost / 10) / allocation multiplier
}}}

For example, a 6000 credit research would take 6000 game minutes. Game time advances in 10 minutes per step, and the screen displays 600 for convenience. On normal speed, this would take 600 seconds or 10 real minutes to complete. If you increase the research money to 12000, the research time decreases to 300 real seconds. If you decrease the money to 1500 credits, the research time jumps to 2400 seconds.

  * The research progress depends on the percent of required and available research labs, but more labs of any kind will not mean greater percent.

For example, a technology uses 1 civil and 1 mechanical development centers. If you have 0 civil and 1 mechanical centers, the research will progress up to 50% and stop there. If you have 0 civil and 2 mechanical centers, the research will still go up to 50%.

== Production ==

The production speed depends mainly on how many factories you have and what efficiency they operate. The production progress is proportional to this capacity. 

{{{
Production time = Cost * 50 / capacity
}}}

For example, you want to produce one fighter of cost 600 credits and you have 1000 spaceship capacity. The production will create a 20 credits worth of fighter per 10 ingame minutes, which translates to 30 real time seconds to complete a single fighter.

Of course, if the capacity would be 60000, it would construct 2 fighters per real time seconds.

== Construction & Upgrading ==

The construction has a simple mechanic. A building has a hitpoint value equal to its cost. The construction increased 200 hit points per 10 ingame minutes.

{{{
Construction time = Cost / 200
}}}

For example, constructing a colony hub of 40000 credits takes 200 seconds or 2000 ingame minutes (about 1 day and 9 hours).

If you upgrade a building. It will switch back to 25% of construction level and is inoperable until it reaches its 100% completion again.

== Repairing ==

The repairing mechanics has a twist. 

If you have a *Fire Brigade* on your planet, it will repair your buildings up to 50% health (or more, depending on the ugrade level of the Fire Brigade) for free. If you have a heavily damaged building and turn the repair on manually, it won't cost you money until it reaches this 50% health. Starting from 50%, it works as a regular repair.

The repair will improve 50 hitpoints for 20 credits per 10 ingame minutes. 

However, if the Fire Brigade is damaged itself, but still operational, it will only repair a proportion of this 50 hitpoints for free (at least 25 hitpoints, because it is the 50% efficiency mark). 

Regular repair is always fixing 50 hipoints per turn.
