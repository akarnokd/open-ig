== Building Upgrade System ==

The *new Building Upgrade System* has been introduced to solve two problems coming from the original game:

  * Allow the player to meet demands (energy, food, etc.) even when the current planet has no more building space.
  * Fix the issue with the random power-outputs of power plants: Open-IG uses a constant for power and upgrades multiply the output to meet the initial demands of the alien planets.

A new panel has been added to the colony screen under the existing building information panel:

http://open-ig.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/open-ig/doc/open-ig-upgrade-panel.png

The user can click on the stars to upgrade a building to a certain level. It is still undecided whether to allow removing upgrades from a building (probably not). The only requirement is money: each upgrade level costs the building's own value (or more?).

Not all buildings offer four levels of upgrade.

When an upgraded building is demolished, the upgrade level is considered: the player will receive the half of the invested money.

The general rule for the upgrade system is that each level will increase the output, the energy and worker demand of the building. Three exceptional case exist:

  * Upgrading from Level 3 to Level 4 does not increase the energy and worker demand, but only the capacity.
  * Factories (Spaceship, Equipment, Weapons) increase capacity but their demands increase more rapidly: a necessary balance option.
  * Research centers do not increase their capacity, but instead, they reduce the energy and worker requirements: again, a necessary balance option.
