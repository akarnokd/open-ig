This page allows the user to switch between the supported languages. In version 0.8, these options are hard coded to Hungarian and English.

== Files page ==

The most important setup page is the Files page. Here must the resource files or directories be selected:

  * Image directories or image ZIP file(s), named open-ig-images-`*`.zip
  * Audio directories or audio ZIP file(s), named open-ig-audio-`*`.zip
  * Video directories or video ZIP file(s), named open-ig-video-`*`.zip
  * Data directories or data ZIP file(s), named open-ig-data-`*`.zip

To allow patching/changing the resources without re-downloading everything, the system supports ordering of these files: put newer or override files in front.

There is an auto locate option to look for these files in the active directory.

== Graphics page ==

On this page, the user can set the game window's position and size. This is useful when a predefined sized screenshot or video recording needs to be done.

The troubleshooting options lets the user disable some acceleration properties if performance or rendering anomalies occur.
