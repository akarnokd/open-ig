#summary What Imperium Galactica 3 should have been.

= Introduction =

I always wanted to make my own (IP) 4X game similar to Imperium Galactica. Unfortunately, I'm a software developer, and a game of such magnitude requires graphic designers, sound designers and story designers besides the general UI and mechanics.

This page summarizes some of my thoughts and requirements of the game.

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Game technology =

  * Multi-platform: Windows, Linux & Mac
  * 3D
  * Scalable UI (don't want to read 5 pixel labels)

= Story, races =

  * ?
  * Unique ships and buildings (e.g., no cheap IG2)

= Resources =

  * Primary resource is credits
  * Asteroid & Planet mining
    * Metal: for ship construction
    * Precious metals: for electronic equipment
    * Light elements: for fusion/anti material?

= Model, mechanics =

  * Money:
    * Taxation of colonists
    * Taxation of traders (e.g., if they land, not on a daily basis)
    * Income is computed on the integral of morale (e.g., not just the last second demand stances, if you have temporary energy shortage, you get a bad evaluation in IG)
  * Population
    * More realism: only certain percent of the population is available for work
  * Own trading fleets
    * transfer of resources and population
  * Ships and fleets require personnel

= Buildings =

  * Usual: colony hub, housing, food, entertainment, energy, factory, research, barracks, guns, shields
  * New: school -> improve production performance
  * New: university -> improve research performance
  * New: outpost -> smaller defense building
  * New: Ability to manually set the energy and worker level per building 
  * New: Mining
  * New: some underwater buildings for full-water planets, mostly mining/research planets?!

= Warfare =

  * Space battle
  * Ground battle
    * Orbital strikes, damages area!
      * COD AC 130 style FPS mode???
    * Air units (e.g., fighters)
    * Anti air units
  * Underwater battle?

= Other =
