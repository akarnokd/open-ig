#summary Collection of issues, solution and gameplay ideas on space realism.

I collect some points about space and realism problems here:

  * Sound effects in space battles or travel sounds.
  * Space is too big; 
    * up to scale would visually problematic, 
    * travel times huge, 
    * easy to miss meeting points.
  * Faster Than Light; 
    * without it, a journey within a solar system would take hours at least
    * if we consider acceleration/deceleration, that is even worse
    * relativity consideration, crew ages slower
    * going FTL: exotic matter, black-hole levels of energy to warp space-time
    * jump gates, wormholes to skip distances
  * Planets are huge
    * buildable area is huge, you could easily build billions of buildings
    * billions of inhabitants
    * all this times hundreds or thousands of habitable planets
  * Construction can take months or years instead of hours or days
  * Research takes months
    * Always going on on many fields
    * Could be focused -> Make fields more attractive by funding and researching something valuable has higher chance.

  * Instant move of inventory
  * Instant commands across several lightyears?
