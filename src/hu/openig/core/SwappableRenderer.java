 * one thread issues the getBackbuffer() and swap() calls. The underlying
 * synchronization will take care of the drawing in the event thread. The
 * init() method should be called before any attempt to use the getBackbuffer() method.
 * The renderer and controller should use another means of communicating how to render the
 * supplied images (e.g. scaling, positioning).
