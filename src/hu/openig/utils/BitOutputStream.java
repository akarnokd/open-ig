 * The BitOutputStream allows writing individual bits to a general Java
 * OutputStream. Like the various Stream-classes from Java, the BitOutputStream
 * has to be created based on another OutputStream. This class is able to write
 * a single bit to a stream (even though a byte has to be filled until the data
 * is flushed to the underlying output stream). It is also able to write an
 * integer value to the stream using the specified number of bits.
 * It is not threadsafe!
