# Introduction #

During the development, many of the game's resource files might change: new images added, older ones changed, subtitles fixed etc.

Unfortunately, the total game is over 1GB in size and would be unpractical to redownload every time a new release comes out.

To avoid this, the game starting from version 0.8 uses an user-changeable ordering of the resource files:

The changes to the resource files will be delivered in update packs of zip files. This file must be manually added to the top of the list shown above. It will override the earlier content.

The upgrade packages will be numbered by release date:

`open-ig-upgrade-2010-08-21.zip`

The **Auto locate** button should automatically place the upgrade packages in correct order.

These upgrade packs should be downloaded as they will not contain any previously modified resources.
