# Introduction #

Due the upload size limit and smaller download sizes, I packaged the game resources into separate ZIP files. Most resources have a specific language in them (e.g. Hungarian labels or English voiceover), therefore, if you don't want the other language, you don't need to download that package.

Besides this, I added a version number to the packages, but I hope I don't need to fix anything inside them later on.
